# 📊 Segment Tree-Enhanced Retrieval in AI Pipelines  

**Case Study for Data Structures and Algorithms (23CSE203)**  

This project integrates **Data Structures (Segment Tree)** with an **AI-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline** to optimize stock-related queries. It demonstrates how advanced algorithms and AI models can work together for efficient data retrieval, analysis, and user interaction.

## 🚀 Project Overview  

- **Backend (Python + Flask)**  
  - Implements **Segment Trees** for efficient stock query operations (min, max, sum, average over a date range).  
  - Integrates with **Pinecone Vector DB** to store embeddings.  
  - Uses **Google Gemini embeddings + LLM** for natural language queries.  
  - Provides APIs that combine AI + data structure outputs.  

- **Frontend (React + Vite)**  
  - Interactive UI for querying stock data.  
  - Displays AI-enhanced insights along with structured results from the segment tree.  
  - User-friendly interface to test queries.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup  

### 🔹 Backend Setup (Python)  

```bash
# Navigate to backend
cd backend

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run backend server
python app.py

The backend will start running (default: http://127.0.0.1:5000/).

### 🔹 Frontend Setup (React + Vite)

# Navigate to frontend
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

The frontend will run on http://localhost:5173/ by default.

# 🧠 How It Works

**User Query** → User enters a stock-related query in natural language (e.g., *"What is the average price of AAPL between Jan 1 and Jan 15?"*).

**RAG Retrieval** → Gemini embeddings + Pinecone fetch relevant historical stock data.

**Segment Tree Processing** → If the query involves numerical operations (min, max, avg, sum), a Segment Tree processes it efficiently.

**AI + Data Structure Response** → Final response is generated by combining retrieved AI context and Segment Tree calculations.

**Frontend Display** → Results are displayed neatly in the React UI.
